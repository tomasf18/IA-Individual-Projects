# Inteligência Artificial - Individual Projects

This repository contains the individual projects developed for the **"Inteligência Artificial" (Artificial Intelligence)** course, part of the **Bachelor's Degree in Informatics Engineering** at the **University of Aveiro**.

## Projects Overview

The individual projects focus on applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve complex problems. Key areas include search algorithms, heuristic optimization, semantic networks, Bayesian networks, and constraint satisfaction problems. We had a window of 28 hours to complete each project.
